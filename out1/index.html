      <h1>Cadmium Demo</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Cadmium demonstration!  Hopefully this demonstration will help you understand the different features that Cadmium offers and how it can be used to publish static content in an efficient manner.</p>
      <h2>Cadmium is not a CMS</h2>
      <p>Although Cadmium does deal with content, it does not provide the features that you would associate with a modern CMS.  Cadmium does not provide WYSIWYG editors for page content or templating engines for page layout.  It leaves those tasks to other applications.</p>
      <h2>Then What is Cadmium, Technically?</h2>
      <p>Cadmium is a Content Versioning and Distribution System.  It is intended to be tied with applications that render static content, like <a href="https://github.com/bevry/docpad" title="DocPad">DocPad</a> or <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress">Octopress</a>.  This setup has several advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It moves content rendering out of the HTTP request/response cycle, improving page load times.</li>
        <li>It reduces the number of moving parts in production, reducing the risk of failure.</li>
        <li>It allows Web Developers to have more control over the content creation process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How Is Cadmium Controlled</h2>
      <p>Cadmium comes with a CLI (Command Line Interface) that can deploy/undepoy sites, commit new content into a site, clone content from one site to another, etc.  Let's have a demonstration of that right now...</p>
