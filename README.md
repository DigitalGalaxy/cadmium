=======

Cadmium is a content versioning and distribution system that focuses on easily moving statically generated content
between environments.  Teamed up with appilcations like [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad) and 
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/), it provides a fast system for getting interactive web content out of development,
through testing and into production.
