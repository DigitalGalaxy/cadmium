# So, Cadmium is great.  It's fantastic software.  But, whoever wrote it must have had something against inline comments.

#Let's talk about inline comments for a minute.    If somebody  else besides you is ever, EVER going to look at, attempt to debug,
# or modify your code....they are going to have to expend a lot of effort trying to decipher your code.  Let's say this person
#isn't that familiar with your language of choice.  Maybe they are new to your style of coding.  Maybe they have a hangover and
#are having a hard time concentrating.  Maybe they just have no idea what you are trying to do in a particular spot and are 
#getting lost in a net of obscure method calls.

#OR MAYBE ALL 4 at once!!!!  /codegrouch

#So, PLEASE, who ever is reading this; spell it out.  The human brain is a, biological construct, well-suitied to running around
#and doing monkey things, not so well suited to following logical patterns completely separate from anything found in the natural 
#world.  So, give the poor monkey brains of your fellow humans a break by providing a tiny, tiny bit of conceptual scaffolding
#with a measly inline comment.  "This method does this thing." is really all you need. Pretend you are explaining this code to 
#somebody who a)is less skilled than yourself, and b) has a really bad hangover, and who still somehow needs to muddle through 
#the innards of the brilliant logic you have created in spite of these two things.  

#Comments.  Please. This Cadmium program is amazing.  It is also going to take me longer to make sense of than it took the devs 
#to actually write it.  Comments...



#(The variables, however, are all well-named and human readable.  Thank you, nameless Cadmium devs, for naming your variables in a
#descriptive and helpful manner.)

#For the love of the collective, global Internet hive mind, COMMENT YOUR FLIPPIN CODE!!!!!  PLZ!!!!
