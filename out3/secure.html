      <h1>Secure</h1>
      <p>Cadmium provides support for marking some pages as secure, so that they will use the https protocol when they are accessed.  This support only applies to pages that are served with the
      content type text/html.</p>
      <h2>Making a Page Secure</h2>
      <p>The /META-INF/secure.json file provides configuration for pages that should be secure.  Any file that is text/html and has a URL that matches one of the configured regular expressions will be redirected to the https protocol.  Any text/html page that is requested with https and does not match one of the configured urls will be redirected to the http protocol.  Here is the configuration used to make this page secure:</p>
