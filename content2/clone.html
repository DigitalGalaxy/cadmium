      <h1>Cloning Content</h1>
      <p>During the development of an interactive website, it needs to move through different environments on its way to production.  Cadmium is designed to ease this process by allowing users to clone content from one website to another.</p>
      <h2>The Clone Command</h2>
      <p>The Cadmium CLI Clone command performs the content distribution feature of Cadmium.  This command takes a source website and a destination website as arguments.  After the command completes, the
      content of the target website will be the same as source website.  Here is the format of the command:</p>
      <div class="snippet">
        > cadmium clone -m &lt;message&gt; &lt;source_site&gt; &lt;target_site&gt;
      </div>
      <p>This command is used recursively to move content from the development site to production.  To understand this better, let's look at an <a href="./example.html" title="Example Production Push">example production push</a>.</p>
